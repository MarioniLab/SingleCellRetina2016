# Transcriptome Analysis of iPSC-Derived Cone Photoreceptor Cells

## Overview

This repository provides the code for the paper **Isolation and Comparative Transcriptome Analysis of Human Fetal and iPSC-Derived Cone Photoreceptor Cells**
by [Welby et al. (2017)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.stemcr.2017.10.018).

## Single-cell analysis

1. Enter the `scRNAseq/` directory.
2. Download the processed count table from [ArrayExpress](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/arrayexpress/experiments/E-MTAB-6058/).
3. Run the `retina_analysis.Rmd` script.
